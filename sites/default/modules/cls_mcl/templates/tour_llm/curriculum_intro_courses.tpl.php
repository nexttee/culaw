These courses are designed to introduce you to common law methodology and basic concepts in American legal thought and practice.</p>
<p class="article">IAL offers a selective overview of the Law Schoolâ€™s first-year curriculum through close reading and critical discussion of cases in civil and criminal procedure and constitutional, criminal, and private law. LRW helps you strengthen the fundamental research, writing, and analytical skills you use in legal practice.</p>
